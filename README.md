[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eulerto/pgquarrel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eulerto/pgquarrel)

Introduction
============

**pgquarrel** is a program that compares [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database schemas (DDL).

Given two database connections, it output a file that represent the difference between schemas. It means that if you run the output file into the *from* database, it'll have the same schema as the *to* database. The main use case is to deploy database changes into testing, staging or production environment.

**pgquarrel** does not rely on another tool (such as **pg\_dump**) instead it connects directly to PostgreSQL server, obtain meta data from catalog, compare objects and output the commands necessary to turn *from* database into *to* database.

It could work with different PostgreSQL versions. The generated file could not work as expected if the *to* PostgreSQL version is greater than *from* PostgreSQL version. That's because the tool could generate commands that does not exist in a prior PostgreSQL version.


It works with different operating systems. It was tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows.

Installation
============

**pgquarrel** is distributed as a source package and can be downloaded at [GitHub](http://github.com/eulerto/pgquarrel). The installation steps depend on your operating system.

You can also keep up with the latest fixes and features cloning the Git repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eulerto/pgquarrel.git
```

UNIX based Operating Systems
----------------------------

Before installing **pgquarrel**, you should have PostgreSQL 9.0+ installed (including the header files). If PostgreSQL is not in your search path add -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/pgsql to the cmake command.

```
$ tar -zxf pgquarrel-0.3.0.tgz
$ cd pgquarrel-0.3.0
$ cmake .
$ make
```

Windows
-------

You should have CMake 2.8.11+ installed and MS Visual Studio (tested with 2017). Open CMake Gui. If PostgreSQL is not in your path add an entry CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH (e.g. C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/10). Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX if you want to install in another directory. Click on 'Configure' and then 'Generate'. Open MS Visual Studio project (path is specified in CMake Gui), right-click on ALL_BUILD and 'Compile'. After that right-click on INSTALL and 'Deploy'.

Features
========

**pgquarrel** does not support all of the PostgreSQL objects. Also, **pgquarrel** does not manipulate data (i.e. DML).

Although **pgquarrel** does not support all PostgreSQL objects, it covers many of the use cases. In future releases, we expect to implement the TODO items to cover more cases. The main absences are:

* inheritance;
* roles.

Tests
=====

```
$ # adjust test/run-test.sh
$ cd pgquarrel-0.3.0/test
$ # test using 10 on both clusters
$ ./run-test.sh 10 10 init
```
